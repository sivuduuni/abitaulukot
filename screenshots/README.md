# Screenshots

## iOS

iOS screenshots were created using [https://www.storeshots.net] for
these devices:

 * 6.5 inch (iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR)
 * 5.5 inch (iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus)
 * 12.9 inch (iPad Pro (3rd generation))

Steps to reproduce:

 1. Take screenshots from http://cheat.abitti.fi using Firefox.
    Use Responsive Design Mode (Ctrl+Shift+M). You need three
    screenshots, one from each device from the list above.
 1. Log in to StoreShots and make your images. It is enough to
    export images for `iPhone 5.5"`, `iPhone 6.5"` and
    `iPad Pro 12.9" (3rd Gen)`
