# Placeholder for the Original Videos

The original koe-ohje contains videos which are replaced with a placeholder video. This
directory contains stuff for creating the placeholder video.

 * `title.odp` is LibreOffice presentation file exported to `title.png`
 * `video-placeholder` contains a OpenShot video project which creates a 5-second
   ogg video. The Makefile converts this to webm. It would be elegant to
   make this with a `ffmpeg` oneliner. Feel free to contribute!
